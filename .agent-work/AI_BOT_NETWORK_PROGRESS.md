# Minglora AI Bot Network — Recovery & Progress

## Project identity

- Canonical product: Minglora Social Network.
- AI feature: first-party Minglora AI Bot Network, built as an isolated Minglora feature.
- Repository: ravaunrichards/Minglora-Social-Network.
- Base verified before this work: main commit d7515fdd16db69f307143ab0235f704970e5ec03.
- Working branch: feat/minglora-ai-bot-network-core.
- This work does not use the separate Nexora, ZUNO or other repositories.

## Recovery checkpoint

- Current phase: AI-NETWORK-FOUNDATION — IN PROGRESS.
- Latest implementation areas: domain service, owner-scoped API routes, dedicated store collections, service tests and feature documentation.
- Provider execution remains deliberately disabled.
- No live AI provider credentials have been added, changed or exposed.
- No user records, social posts, Coin balances, gifts, LIVE sessions or production settings have been changed.
- No fake bots, fake runs, fake performance metrics or sample community activity have been seeded.

## Verified implementation so far

- [x] Confirmed AI assistant/creation was marked missing in the existing Minglora feature catalog.
- [x] Confirmed no AI/Bot module existed in the latest repository tree before this branch.
- [x] Recovered the ten approved recommendations: Personality Lab, Bot Teams, Smart Scheduling, Performance Center, Multilingual Intelligence, AI Creator Studio, Security & Trust Center, opt-in AI companionship, AI Community Events and central Bot Command Center.
- [x] Documented mandatory safeguards and scope in docs/AI_BOT_NETWORK.md.
- [x] Added backend/modules/ai-network/service.js with owner-scoped domain rules.
- [x] Added isolated AI-owned collections to the existing store collection registry.
- [x] Added authenticated /api/ai-network route family.
- [x] Added an initial service regression suite in tests/unit/ai-network.test.js.
- [x] Bot records carry an AI identity label and begin as drafts.
- [x] Schedules and the global network begin paused.
- [x] High-impact approval records never execute their underlying action.
- [x] Financial, Coin, admin, account, security and destructive moderation actions are not delegable.
- [x] Companion opt-in requires explicit AI-identity acknowledgement and can be withdrawn.
- [x] Performance counts are derived only from actual stored run events.
- [x] Emergency pause preserves history while pausing bots, schedules and queued/running records.

## Not yet verified / unfinished

- [ ] Run CI and correct all test failures.
- [ ] Add the responsive AI Network workspace and navigation entry.
- [ ] Add the provider adapter; keep execution disabled until it passes security and integration tests.
- [ ] Add durable scheduler/worker claims, retries, idempotency, and per-owner budget reservation.
- [ ] Add measured performance telemetry and actual cost/token accounting.
- [ ] Add multilingual provider execution and original/translated content labelling.
- [ ] Add Creator Studio output generation and required human review/publish handoff.
- [ ] Add bot team orchestration without duplicate actions or hidden human impersonation.
- [ ] Add companion conversation sessions, retention enforcement and deletion/withdrawal flow.
- [ ] Integrate opt-in events with Minglora Events/RSVP and moderation.
- [ ] Add adversarial prompt-injection tests, authorization/RLS tests, rate-limit tests and audit review.
- [ ] Verify responsive behavior, accessibility, provider-disabled/error states and recovery.
- [ ] Verify deployed runtime and update the canonical feature catalogue.
- [ ] Complete normalized transactional storage and multi-instance readiness before enabling production scale.

## Completion reporting

Do not report a percentage until every requirement is decomposed and weighted. A route or UI shell alone is not completion. Keep each recommendation status in AI_BOT_NETWORK_STAGE_QUEUE.md and mark it complete only after the corresponding acceptance tests and deployed checks pass.
